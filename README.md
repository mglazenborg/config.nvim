# Neovim config

My personal Neovim config. Might work for you, might not.

Using this config on the following systems:

- GNU/Linux ([Arch](https://archlinux.org/))
- Windows Subsystem for Linux ([Arch](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Install_Arch_Linux_on_WSL))

## Getting started

If you are copying this you are probably smart enough to figure it out.
Just use `checkhealth` to see if you are missing any dependencies and install them if needed.
